#  Analysis Preparation on  COVID-19 datasets

In this project, I want to specify the most affected countries in one day, different features, to calculation maximum, minimum, mean for Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered and Active, check missing values, Separate dates to see how many days, how many months, how many years.
# Dataset Description

The data source from kaggle and contains 10 columns and 490,69 rows. The data contains the following columns:
1) Province/State 
2) Country/Region 
3) Lat 
4) Long 
5) Date 
6) Confirmed 
7) Deaths 
8) Recovered 
9) Active 
10) WHO Region

# Objectives 

This project will help to clearly analyze the data and display statistical graphics to facilitate the understanding of the data.

# Linear Regression Modelling objective
Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable. This model will help to predict active case of the COVID-19  per month

# Tools

I will use Jupyter Notbbok, Programming Lanaguage, Libraries like Pandas,NumPy,Sklearn,Matplotlib,Tensorflow

#  Analysis Preparation on  COVID-19 datasets

# Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

# Problem
-  Identify the maximum, minimum, median for the Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active?
-  Compare between Deaths and Active?
-  How many the Total Corona Virus Active vs Recovered Recovered?
-  Visualize the missingness issue in the dataset and check missing values?
-  How many days, how many months, how many years in the dataset?
-  How to predict active cases per month? 
   
# Dataset Description

The data source from kaggle and contains 10 columns and 490,69 rows. The data contains the following columns:
1) Province/State 
2) Country/Region 
3) Lat 
4) Long 
5) Date 
6) Confirmed 
7) Deaths 
8) Recovered 
9) Active 
10) WHO Region

# Project Objectives 

This project will help to clearly analyze the data and display statistical graphics to facilitate the understanding of the data.

# Linear Regression modelling objective
Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable. This model will help to predict active case of the COVID-19  per month

# Tools

I will use Jupyter Notbbok, Programming Lanaguage, Libraries like Pandas,NumPy,Sklearn,Matplotlib,Tensorflow
